## Postgres Version Changes

### Postgres 9
Postgres 9 is the original version based on this [blog post](https://medium.com/@2hamed/replicating-postgres-inside-docker-the-how-to-3244dc2305be).


### Postgres 10 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html

- Configure ReadOnly replica as **Hot Standby**

  **Why**: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hot_Standby

  >Hot Standby is the name for the capability to run queries on a database that is currently performing archive recovery. Log Shipping replication allows you to create one or more standby nodes that are replicas of the primary node (or master node). Standby nodes can then be used for read-only query access.

  >Do not configure as [Warm Standby](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Warm_Standby)

  **How**:
  - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/hot-standby.html
  - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-wal.html

    >`wal_level` determines how much information is written to the WAL. The default value is `replica`, which writes enough data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running read-only queries on a standby server. `minimal` removes all logging except the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown. Finally, `logical` adds information necessary to support logical decoding. Each level includes the information logged at all lower levels. This parameter can only be set at server start.
    >
    >In releases prior to 9.6, this parameter also allowed the values `archive` and `hot_standby`. These are still accepted but mapped to `replica`.


### Postgres 11 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/release-11.html

- No Change Needed


### Postgres 12 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/release-12.html

- Move `recovery.conf` settings to `postgresql.conf`

  **Why**: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/release-12.html#id-1.11.6.28.4

  >Move recovery.conf settings into postgresql.conf (Masao Fujii, Simon Riggs, Abhijit Menon-Sen, Sergei Kornilov) ยง
  >
  >`recovery.conf` is no longer used, and the server will not start if that file exists. `recovery.signal` and `standby.signal` files are now used to switch into non-primary mode. The `trigger_file` setting has been renamed to `promote_trigger_file`. The standby_mode setting has been removed.

  **How**:
  - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/recovery-config.html

    >The server will not start if a `recovery.conf` exists.
    >The `trigger_file` setting has been renamed to [`promote_trigger_file`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-PROMOTE-TRIGGER-FILE).
    >The `standby_mode` setting has been removed. A `standby.signal` file in the data directory is used instead.  See [Standby Server Operation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/warm-standby.html#STANDBY-SERVER-OPERATION) for details.


### Postgres 13 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html

- Replace `wal_keep_segments` with `wal_keep_size`

  **Why**: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html#id-1.11.6.24.4

  >Rename configuration parameter `wal_keep_segments` to `wal_keep_size` (Fujii Masao) ยง
  >This determines how much WAL to retain for standby servers. It is specified in megabytes, rather than number of files as with the old parameter.

  **How**: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html#id-1.11.6.24.4

  >If you previously used `wal_keep_segments`, the following formula will give you an approximately equivalent setting:

  ```sh
  wal_keep_size = wal_keep_segments * wal_segment_size (typically 16MB)
  ```


### Postgres 14 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14.html

- No Change Needed


### Postgres 15 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/release-15.html

- No Change Needed


### Postgres 16 Specific Changes

References: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html

- Deprecate server variable `promote_trigger_file`

  **Why**: https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=cd4329d93

  >Previously, an idle startup (recovery) process would wake up every 5
  >seconds to have a chance to poll for promote_trigger_file, even if that
  >GUC was not configured.  That promotion triggering mechanism was
  >effectively superseded by pg_ctl promote and pg_promote() a long time
  >ago.  There probably aren't many users left and it's very easy to change
  >to the modern mechanisms, so we agreed to remove the feature.
  >
  >This is part of a campaign to reduce wakeups on idle systems.
